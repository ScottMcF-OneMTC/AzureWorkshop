# Azure Engineering Workshop for Enterprises

This repository is an aggregation of links and content to support a multi-day Azure workshop delivered by an Azure technical expert, focused on medium to large enterprises that are adopting Azure beyond a few subscriptions. The content is based on dozens of workshops delivered on the Microsoft Redmond campus between our Core Services Engineering & Operations engineers and engineers from our large enterprise customers.
